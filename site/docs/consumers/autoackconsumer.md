# AutoAckConsumer

An `AutoAckConsumer` acknowledges every consumed message automatically, so all you need to worry about is to process the message. Keep in mind that messages whose processing fails will still be acknowledged to `RabbitMQ` meaning that messages could get lost.

```scala mdoc:silent
import cats.effect.IO
import cats.implicits.*
import dev.profunktor.fs2rabbit.model.*
import dev.profunktor.fs2rabbit.interpreter.RabbitClient
import fs2.Stream

val queueName = QueueName("daQ")

val doSomething: Stream[IO, AmqpEnvelope[String]] => IO[Unit] = consumer => IO.unit

def program(R: RabbitClient[IO]) =
  R.createConnectionChannel.use { implicit channel =>
    R.createAutoAckConsumer[String](queueName).flatMap(doSomething)
  }
```

When creating a consumer, you can tune the configuration by using `BasicQos` and `ConsumerArgs`. By default, the `basicQOS` is set to a prefetch size of 0, a prefetch count of 1 and `global` is set to false. The `ConsumerArgs` is `None` by default since it's optional. When defined, you can indicate `consumerTag` (default is ""), `noLocal` (default is false), `exclusive` (default is false) and `args` (default is an empty `Map[String, *]`).
